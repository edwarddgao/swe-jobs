Fundusol’s core innovation is a holistic modeling suite that takes in the solar and agricultural specifications of a given agrivoltaic project. The model uses panel geometry and irradiance data to predict shadowing dynamics beneath the system, and computational fluid dynamics to model temperatures throughout the system. These are both fed into a field\-scale biomass model to forecast both biomass growth of the specific crops grown beneath the panels as well as a recommended irrigation schedule. Additionally, the model leverages pvWatts to forecast solar production throughout the system’s lifetime, allowing for a holistic view of system performance. By iterating over possible system designs, the model enables us to design an optimal system and make agricultural recommendations for any agrivoltaic project anywhere in the country.

Fundusol leverages this modeling suite and domain expertise to consult the largest solar developers in the world on the design and execution of agrivoltaics projects. We are backed by Stanford, CMU, and the Department of Energy. We commercialized in the summer of 2024, and have since designed over 850MW of projects. As we continue to grow rapidly, we are looking to bring on a partner to execute client projects, bring clients to our firm, expand our capabilities, and contribute to the exciting field of agrivoltaics.

**Roles**

**Data Engineer** 

We are looking to hire our first data engineer. Whomever we hire will enable the seamless collection, transformation, analysis and integration of large\-scale datasets, which are essential for training cutting\-edge machine learning models. The role involves ensuring data quality and integrity through rigorous processes, collaborating closely with cross\-functional teams to meet data requirements, and optimizing workflows for efficiency and scalability. As the first person hired into this role, you will stay at the forefront of data engineering and machine learning innovations, contributing to the continuous improvement of our infrastructure. The ideal candidate will have strong programming skills in Python, experience with SQL, cloud platforms, and big data technologies. If this sounds like you, please apply!

**Full Stack Engineer** 

We’re looking for an exceptional full stack engineer who thinks business first, code second. You’re the kind of person who starts projects from scratch and works relentlessly to see them through. The ideal candidate has significant experience with frontend frameworks like React and backend technologies like Python, and is comfortable owning all aspects of shipping a user\-facing product—from deploying infrastructure to iterating based on customer feedback. You’ll be responsible for the software that humans interact with at Fundusol—everything from interfacing with our predictive models to keeping track of project leads.

**CUDA Engineer** 

We are seeking an engineer with demonstrated experience in CUDA programming to optimize and enhance our computational models of Agrivoltaic systems. This role requires deep expertise in parallel computing and experience in developing high\-performance simulations, especially in irradiance modeling and thermodynamic calculations. As a CUDA Engineer, you will work closely with our research and data science teams to design and implement optimized algorithms that efficiently simulate the energy flows and environmental impacts of solar\-integrated agricultural systems.
