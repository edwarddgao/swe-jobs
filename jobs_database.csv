Fundusol’s core innovation is a holistic modeling suite that takes in the solar and agricultural specifications of a given agrivoltaic project. The model uses panel geometry and irradiance data to predict shadowing dynamics beneath the system, and computational fluid dynamics to model temperatures throughout the system. These are both fed into a field\-scale biomass model to forecast both biomass growth of the specific crops grown beneath the panels as well as a recommended irrigation schedule. Additionally, the model leverages pvWatts to forecast solar production throughout the system’s lifetime, allowing for a holistic view of system performance. By iterating over possible system designs, the model enables us to design an optimal system and make agricultural recommendations for any agrivoltaic project anywhere in the country.

Fundusol leverages this modeling suite and domain expertise to consult the largest solar developers in the world on the design and execution of agrivoltaics projects. We are backed by Stanford, CMU, and the Department of Energy. We commercialized in the summer of 2024, and have since designed over 850MW of projects. As we continue to grow rapidly, we are looking to bring on a partner to execute client projects, bring clients to our firm, expand our capabilities, and contribute to the exciting field of agrivoltaics.

**Roles**

**Data Engineer** 

We are looking to hire our first data engineer. Whomever we hire will enable the seamless collection, transformation, analysis and integration of large\-scale datasets, which are essential for training cutting\-edge machine learning models. The role involves ensuring data quality and integrity through rigorous processes, collaborating closely with cross\-functional teams to meet data requirements, and optimizing workflows for efficiency and scalability. As the first person hired into this role, you will stay at the forefront of data engineering and machine learning innovations, contributing to the continuous improvement of our infrastructure. The ideal candidate will have strong programming skills in Python, experience with SQL, cloud platforms, and big data technologies. If this sounds like you, please apply!

**Full Stack Engineer** 

We’re looking for an exceptional full stack engineer who thinks business first, code second. You’re the kind of person who starts projects from scratch and works relentlessly to see them through. The ideal candidate has significant experience with frontend frameworks like React and backend technologies like Python, and is comfortable owning all aspects of shipping a user\-facing product—from deploying infrastructure to iterating based on customer feedback. You’ll be responsible for the software that humans interact with at Fundusol—everything from interfacing with our predictive models to keeping track of project leads.

**CUDA Engineer** 

We are seeking an engineer with demonstrated experience in CUDA programming to optimize and enhance our computational models of Agrivoltaic systems. This role requires deep expertise in parallel computing and experience in developing high\-performance simulations, especially in irradiance modeling and thermodynamic calculations. As a CUDA Engineer, you will work closely with our research and data science teams to design and implement optimized algorithms that efficiently simulate the energy flows and environmental impacts of solar\-integrated agricultural systems.

**Ready to be a part of the company transforming FinTech and how the world accesses banking services?**


When was the last time you were excited about interacting with your bank or credit union? If the answer is “a while” then you’re in good company. Despite the fact that access to better financial choices is at the heart of empowering communities, businesses, and people, financial institutions (FIs) are struggling to keep up with modern expectations.


And that’s where Kinective comes in. We’re here to change the way the world accesses and thinks about banking through software that connects a historically “boring” industry to the latest and greatest fintechs shaping the industry.


Ok... but what does all of that *actually* mean? Banks and credit unions are using some pretty old\-school systems, which makes adopting new and innovative technology difficult (if not impossible). If you think it’s easy for your local branch to send you a receipt via text… think again.


Want proof? As the largest provider of software connectivity to 1 in 4 U.S. financial institutions, we are the leading company transforming the way banking is done for credit unions and banks. (In fact, Forbes recently released their Best Banks in the World report, and Kinective works with over 60% of their named banks!).


Kinective is the connector (get it?) that bridges that technology gap and helps modernize the way banking works. Our 300\+ team of mega\-talented and passionate folks are brought together with the unifying desire to make life easier (and better) for our clients and ultimately paving the way for banks and credit unions to modernize banking for everyone.

**The Cliffs Notes** (*Role Summary*)


As the Software Engineering Intern at Kinective, you will be instrumental in supporting the development of automation tools and systems that will enhance operational efficiency and support ongoing initiatives. This role will report to an Engineering Lead and be a part of a team of 3 or 5 engineers. You are a problem solver, eager to dive into hands\-on projects, collaborate with a dynamic team, and contribute to meaningful outcomes.


A day in the life of this role might involve spending about 60% of your time on development tasks (coding, tool creation, troubleshooting) and 40% on testing, collaborating with other team members, and supporting the documentation process.

  

Kinective's internship program spans 12 weeks, beginning on June 2, 2025 and concluding on Aug. 15, 2025\.


This is a paid position at $20 / hour.

***Candidates must reside within commuting distance of our headquarters in Gilbert, AZ.***

**What you’ll own:**

* Develop and enhance internal tools to improve automation and efficiency.
* Collaborate with the team to integrate and communicate with internal web APIs.
* Assist in building and improving simulators for internal processes and systems.
* Contribute to the development and improvement of testing and deployment processes.
* Work with team members to ensure seamless integration of tools with existing systems.
* Conduct testing, debugging, and troubleshooting of developed tools.
* Provide support for documentation and assist in tracking project progress.
* Participate in team meetings and contribute to brainstorming and problem\-solving.

**What you’re great at:**

* Strong problem\-solving skills, with an ability to break down complex issues and provide solutions.
* Team player with excellent communication skills, eager to collaborate and share insights.
* Self\-motivated and able to work independently while meeting deadlines.
* Detail\-oriented and committed to delivering high\-quality work.

DUST Identity is a physical object security solution that uses microscopic diamonds to securely tag objects, so they are uniquely identifiable. Think of a barcode, but much smaller, unfalsifiable, and made with diamonds. With DUST, customers can ensure that every physical object — whether an aircraft part, a piece of jewelry, a microprocessor, or a high\-valued art piece — is verified, authenticated, and ultimately, can be trusted.


DUST is a venture capital\-backed startup. Enabled by the development of new materials, cutting edge hardware, and exciting machine vision, we aim to become the industry standard for physical object identification and security.

This role is perfect for someone who is mechanically inclined, has a “hacker” mentality, and isn't afraid to get their hands dirty while also writing code.


What You'll Do:


* Collaborate with engineers and scientists on R\&D projects in the lab


* Develop scripts, tools, and software applications to support lab operations


* Assemble, modify, or troubleshoot hardware and mechanical setups


* Analyze data from experiments and help automate data collection/processing


* Prototype quick solutions (both physical and digital) to test new ideas


* Document your work and share your findings with the broader team


What We're Looking For:


* Currently pursuing a degree (BA/BS/MS) in Computer Science, Electrical/Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, or a related field


* Experience with one or more programming languages (Python, C/C\+\+, JavaScript/Typescript,, etc.)


* Comfortable using hand tools, basic electronics, and/or mechanical systems


* A self\-starter with a curious, ""figure it out"" mindset


* Excellent problem\-solving skills and the ability to work independently or on a team


* Bonus: Experience with microcontrollers, SBCs, rapid prototyping (laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC milling), CAD, or robotics


Why You'll Love It Here:


* Real projects with real impact


* Access to tools, our Makerspace, mentorship, and a collaborative, supportive lab environment


* Opportunity to develop both your technical and hands\-on skills


* Free snacks, flexible hours, and a fun, fast\-paced summer","","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Dust-Identity","","","","","","","2025-04-04 06:01:13.152298"
